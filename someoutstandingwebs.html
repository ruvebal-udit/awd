        <h2>What is missing?</h2>
        <p>
          An educational website dedicated to environmental conservation, aiming
          to raise awareness of disappearing ecosystems. The project, created by
          artist Maya Lin, combines art with science, creating an interactive
          platform for nature education. The site features delicate, organic
          elements with green accents that reference nature and environmental
          conservation. Graphics and interactive maps enhance visual engagement.
          Users explore the site via an interactive world map, discovering
          endangered ecosystems. Navigation is smooth, and the site, despite
          rich content, remains uncluttered. The creative integration of maps
          with multimedia, such as video, sound, and animations, allows users to
          engage more deeply with the content. The site functions smoothly and
          is well-optimized, though some users may find the map-based navigation
          less intuitive.
